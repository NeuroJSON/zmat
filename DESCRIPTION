Description: ZMat is a portable mex function to enable zlib/gzip/lzma/lz4/zstd/blosc2
 based data compression/decompression and base64 encoding/decoding support
 in MATLAB and GNU Octave. It is fast and compact, can process a large
 array within a fraction of a second. Among the supported compression
 methods, lz4 is the fastest for compression/decompression; lzma is the
 slowest but has the highest compression ratio; zlib/gzip have excellent
 balance between speed and compression time.
